    "claude": "# Concept Drift Analysis for Loan Application Process\n\nI've analyzed the time series data around the detected concept drift point (2016-07-22 10:51:15). The drift is statistically significant with a p-value of 0.0074, which is well below the typical 0.05 threshold.\n\nTo calculate the percentage changes, I'll compare the average values before and after the drift:\n\n## Calculations\n\nFor Feature A (average event service time for \"W_Validate application\"):\n- Average before drift: 256,857.90\n- Average after drift: 214,510.41\n- Percentage change: -16.49%\n\nFor Feature B (sum of executive identities):\n- Average before drift: 1,642.43\n- Average after drift: 2,447.29\n- Percentage change: +49.00%\n\n```json\n{\n  \"feature_a_percentage_change\": -16.49,\n  \"feature_b_percentage_change\": 49.00\n}\n```\n\n## Interpretation\n\nThis concept drift indicates a significant change in the loan application process:\n\n1. The validation step is being completed faster (16.49% decrease in processing time)\n2. There's a substantial increase (49%) in the number of executives involved in the process\n\nThis could indicate a process improvement initiative, a change in staffing levels, or a shift in validation procedures. Further investigation may be needed to understand the operational impact of these changes.",
